From the first time I heard about Vue, my interest was sparked. Many developers love it because it is easy to learn and intuitive. Later, while looking for an internship, I researched many companies and it turns out a whole bunch of them use Vue. Eventually I applied to Little Miss Robot and was accepted for an internship. They also use Vue, so this was the last push to convince me to learn Vue. 

## Core Project Statement
While researching Vue I tried to figure out what it was really good at. It turns out Vue is quite good at animations and transitions, but it’s also used a lot for advanced user interaction. By this I mean interactions that aren’t standard features in html or css and need a lot of customized code, such as swipe gestures, drag and drop, data visualisation and so on.
 
In the past I always avoided these kinds of ui elements, because I was busy with other features and meeting deadlines. In this project I want to make it my mission to learn about all these things, because they are present in most web apps. 

So the goal is to deliver a functional web app. This means I will have to learn the basics of Vue, such as the composition api, routing, state management, … But I want to go further with advanced animations and transitions, authentication with Firebase, a real time database with Firebase, working with a design framework, such as Vuetify, building good unit tests and accessibility. 

## Deliverables 
* Learn Vue to become a Vue developer.
* Building a webapp to apply my Vue skills described above.
* Writing about my progress, struggles, findings, …
* Being more active on Stack Overflow: scrolling through questions and answers, and hopefully, eventually being able to answer some.
