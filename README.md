From the first time I heard about Vue, my interest was sparked. Many developers love it because it is easy to learn and intuitive. Later, while looking for an internship, I researched many companies and it turns out a whole bunch of them use Vue. Eventually I applied to Little Miss Robot and was accepted for an internship. They also use Vue, so this was the last push to convince me to learn Vue. 

## Core Project Statement
While researching Vue I tried to figure out what it was really good at. It turns out Vue is quite good at animations and transitions, but it’s also used a lot for advanced user interaction. By this I mean interactions that aren’t standard features in html or css and need a lot of customized code, such as swipe gestures, drag and drop, data visualisation and so on.
 
I will build a platform that enhances the live concert experience by letting users buy drinks, merchandise online and interact with the artists on stage. There will be different kinds of users: venues, bands and shoppers. They will all have a different views based on what they can do. For more details, you can read [this blog post](https://larsmarginet1.wixsite.com/blog/post/project-overview-concery).

On top of Vue, I will be using Vuetify as UI framework. 

## Deliverables 
* Learn Vue to become a Vue developer.
* Building a webapp to apply my Vue skills described above.
* Writing about my progress, struggles, findings, …
* Being more active on Stack Overflow: scrolling through questions and answers, and hopefully, eventually being able to answer some.
